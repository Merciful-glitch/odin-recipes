        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Dolly Parton and her sister Rachel Parton Geroge grew up with their mama, grandmas, and aunts making this classic dessert from <strong>scratch.</strong></p>
        <p>There are so many versions of banana puddingâ€”or puddin', as we call it. This one allows you to make it from scratch like we do and always have, just like our mama and our grandmas and our aunts used to do. Just be sure to make enough! After putting in the effort, you don't want to be the one to go, "Where's the banana pudding? I missed it!"</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>9 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>2 (12 ounce) boxes vanilla wafers</li>
            <li>6 egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat anf stir in teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools)</li>
            <li>For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using and electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, cream of tarter, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, covering it completely.</li>
            <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it) </li>
            <li>Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill,covered, uo to 4 days)</li>
        </ol>

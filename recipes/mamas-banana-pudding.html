        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Dolly Parton and her sister Rachel Parton Geroge grew up with their mama, grandmas, and aunts making this classic dessert from <strong>scratch.</strong></p>
        <p>There are so many versions of banana puddingâ€”or puddin', as we call it. This one allows you to make it from scratch like we do and always have, just like our mama and our grandmas and our aunts used to do. Just be sure to make enough! After putting in the effort, you don't want to be the one to go, "Where's the banana pudding? I missed it!"</p>
